DATA

The data that I will use is about the borougs and neigborhood of both cities. Each data has the location of the neigborhoods in Ney York and Toronto. 
The other important source of data will be Foursquare, where there is all the info about the facilities in the neigborshoods.

The sources of data are:

New York: https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/fbpwbovar7lf8p5sgddm06cgipa2rxpe.json
Toronto: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
