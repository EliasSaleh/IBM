Introduction

A lot of people nowadays switch their cities to another due work, life opportunities, etc. In north america, one possible switch is from New York in USA to Toronto in Canada, 
or backwards. Is for this reason that I'll compare the two cities in terms of facilities such as coffee shops, gyms, etc. I chose this two cities becuase there is a 
lot of information in the internet and these two were the cities that the course worked.
